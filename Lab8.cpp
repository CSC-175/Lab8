// The factorial of a number n is the product of all numbers from 1 up to the number n.
// For example n=5 then the factorial of 5 will be 1*2*3*4*5= 120, so 5!= 120.
// Write a program that prompts a user to enter a positive integer less than 13 
// then uses a for loop to calculate the factorial of n and print it to the screen.
