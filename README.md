# Factorial Calculator Program

## Background
The factorial of a number n is the product of all numbers from 1 up to the number n.
For example n=5 then the factorial of 5 will be 1*2*3*4*5= 120, so 5 factorial is 120.

## Directions
Write a program that prompts a user to enter a positive integer less than 13 then uses a for loop to calculate the factorial of n and print it to the screen. <b>Note: The factorial of 13 will overflow the 32 bits used to store an integer.</b>

## Interface Prototype Example

### Test Case 1 Output
<pre><b>Enter a positive integer: 7
7 factorial is equal to 5040</b></pre>
### Test Case 2 Output
<pre><b>Enter a positive integer: 8
7 factorial is equal to 40320</b></pre>
### Test Case 3 Output
<pre><b>Enter an integer value: 4
The sum of the digits is 24</b></pre>
